# Remote-Shutter
An rp2040 Xiao based remote shutter and intervalometer with four modes.
This device uses optocouplers to keep the camera isolated from the circuitry. Designed for Canon remote shutter pinout, I dont know how standard it is.
There is an oled screen to change the settings and there is a joystick to select things.
